-- INTRODUCTION

/*
Purpose: This project aims to conduct an analysis of agency sales data for PT Garuda Indonesia (Persero) Tbk, with a focus on 
		identifying top-performing agents, service codes, regions, and routes. The insights derived will support the Agency Sales Unit in developing targeted 
		product offerings, strategic sales programs, and data-driven marketing initiatives to drive sustainable growth across all market segments.
*/

-- Dataset Overview: 

/*
This project uses two datasets:
1. new_2023.csv : This dataset contains flown and sales records in USD of 2023 for travel agents that partnered with Garuda Indonesia, including data types,
				 agents name, region of sales, agent number, routes. Those data are the foundation for this analysis.
2. new_2024.csv : This dataset contains flown and sales records in USD of 2024 for travel agents that partnered with Garuda Indonesia, including data types,
				 agents name, region of sales, agent number, routes. Those data are the foundation for this analysis.

These data altogether allow for a comprehensive view of Agency Sales Unit revenue and routes performance.

DISCLAIMER: This project will strictly used the first Quarter and Months of revenues from 2023 and 2024 due to real datasets usage.
